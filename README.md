# Requirements
üì¢ We don't currently give support to Godot 3+ as we focus on future stable versions from version 4 onwards
* Godot 4+

# ‚ú®Installation
## Automatic (Recommended)
You can download this plugin from the official [Godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2039) using the AssetLib tab in your godot editor. Once installed, you're ready to get started
##  Manual 
To manually install the plugin, create an **"addons"** folder at the root of your Godot project and then download the contents from the **"addons"** folder of this repository
## GDScript version
This plugin has also been written in GDScript and you can find it on [ProjectileComponent](https://github.com/GodotParadise/ProjectileComponent)

# Getting started
This node functions like the others, serving as a child of another node. In this case, it is not restricted to only `CharacterBody2D`, as bullets are typically `Area2D` objects.

# Exported parameters
## Speed
- Max speed
- Acceleration
The **max speed** as the name say, defines the maximum reachable limit of speed that will be apply to the velocity. 

The getter of the speed modify the value based on `SpeedReductionOnPenetration` parameter.

The **acceleration** makes smoother to reach the maximum speed if you want to increase the juiciness of the movement. In case you don't want it just assign a zero value to it and the node will reach the maximum speed immediately

## Homing
- Homing distance
- Homing strength
The **homing distance** defines the maximum distance the projectile will pursue the target if the target is defined. **Leave it at zero** if there is no distance limit.
The purpose of `HomingStrength` is to provide fine-grained control over how aggressively the projectile homes in on the target.

## Penetration
- Max penetrations
- Speed reduction on penetration
The **max penetrations** is an integer value that determines how many times the projectile can penetrate before emitting the `PenetrationComplete` signal. We do not queue-free the node as we leave the behavior to the user, allowing them to handle it by connecting to the signal.
The **speed reduction on penetration** decreases the speed by this amount back to the original maximum speed each time a penetration occurs.

## Bounce
- Bounce enabled
- Bounce times
The **bounce enabled** setting allows the projectile to bounce upon collision or another type of event. 
The **bounce times** parameter determines the number of times this projectile can bounce.

# Accessible normal parameters
- projectile: Node2D
- direction: Vector2
- target: Node2D
- follow_target: bool
- penetration_count
- bounced_positions: Array[Vector2]

# Once upon the scene tree
- Connects to the signal `FollowStarted`
When this projectile starts to follow a target, the component checks if the target can be followed. This means:
1. The target is not null.
2. The homing distance to the target is less than the defined value.
If these conditions are met, the homing behavior begins. Depending on the **`HomingStrength`**, the projectile starts to follow the target smoothly.

# Functions
## Move(double? delta = null)
The projectile starts moving in the `Direction` and at the `MaxSpeed` defined as parameters. In this state, the projectile uses `LookAt` to orient itself towards the provided direction.
## SwapTarget(Node2D NextTarget)
The target is swapped to the provided one as parameter and emit the signal `TargetSwapped`
## StopFollowTarget()
The projectile stop following the target if this is defined. This function set the `Target` to null and `FollowTarget` to false
## BeginFollowTarget(Node2D NewTarget)
The projectile begins to follow the target, and this behavior is activated. This function set the target to `NewTarget` and `FollowTarget` to true
## Vector2 TargetPosition()
If a `Target` is defined, this function returns the normalized direction from this projectile to the target. It returns `Vector2.ZERO` when the `Target` is null.
## Vector2 UpdateFollowDirection(Node2D OnTarget)
Update the direction to follow the target if the projectile is on following mode.
## Vector2 Bounce(Vector2 NewDirection)
The projectile bounces in the direction defined by the `NewDirection` parameter if bouncing is enabled and there are remaining bounces for this projectile. Every succesfull bounce append the position to the `BouncedPositions` array
Typically, you pass the `WallNormal` as a parameter to bounce in the opposite direction, but we don't want to restrict things; the `NewDirection` is flexible. This action also emits the `Bounced` signal.
